## Understanding and Navigating the Notebook

### #notebook/introduction

Entry: 1
Author: Aster Lee<br>Date: 2026-02-14<br>Working Version: 0.0.0

### Navigating the Notebook

- **Any standard Markdown viewer should be able to fully utilize this notebook.**
	- Section links, external links, image embedding, and tables should all be in accordance with standard Markdown syntax.
- **The table of contents contains hyperlinks for convenience.**
	- Entry titles will be hyperlinked to direct the viewer to the corresponding entry.
- **This document should be viewed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for best results**
	- While not vital to function, using Obsidian will provide additional functionality, such as usage of the graph view and functionality of the Tags system. 
- **Some artifacts may appear in other Markdown viewers as a consequence of missing Obsidian functionality.**
	- (e.g. A section of text may be have a preceding hash. This is from the Tag system used in Obsidian. Example: `#tagged_text`)

### Notebook Entry Formatting

**All entries will share the same heading as follows:**

![*Fig. 1.*](photos/2026-02-14_template_image.png)

* *Title* - Title of entry. Gives a specific description or focus for the entry
* *Subtitle Tag* - A subtitle that categorizes the entry into broader categories of similar entries. Takes advantage of Obsidian's tag system to easily organize and search for items.
* *Entry #* - Numerical index for entry. Helps to maintain chronological order and easy identification of entries.
* *Date* - Provides date entry was written.
* *Working version* - Indicates which version of the project the entry was working on. Follows standard [semantic versioning convention.](https://semver.org/)

## Rationale for Selecting Obsidian as a Text Editor

- **Obsidian is a strong tool for organization and workflow management.**
	- Its links, backlinks, tags, and graph view all contribute to a strongly organized system that improves workflow.
	- Less specifically, the general layout, controls, and presentation of tools all feel intuitive to me. This makes it a very appealing choice.
- **Obsidian natively supports Markdown.**
	- Obsidian uses Markdown as its standard text markup language, which vastly improves compatibility with HTML. 
		- Markdown is a markup language accepted as industry standard. It is almost universally utilized in all facets of programming, such as in README files. 
		- Writing documentation in Markdown will ensure this project's documentation is accessible to any interested party.
	- Markdown is also natively supported to be previewed in GitHub repositories. This allows users to preview all documents without having to download any files.

## Creating Goals and Project Timeline

### #time_management

Entry: 2<br>Author: Aster Lee<br>Date: 2026-02-14<br>Working Version: 0.0.0

### New Project Goal

**Finish project planning and design documentation by March 6, 2026. All details should be finalized except for minor revisions that may come later. Project should be in state ready to begin software development by deadline.**

- [x] Goal addresses timeliness.
- [x] Goal specifically addresses what must be achieved.
- [x] Goal addresses what work will contribute towards.

Having a strict, yet realistic goal such as this will help to motivate me. This will ensure I'm keeping a strong pace while not overworking myself. A date of March 6 will give me 20 days, which should be more than enough to get ready even with the busy schedule I keep.
### Creating Project Timeline

Given my busy nature as an honors student, the approach I will take to time management will deviate from typical project timelines.

- Task progress will be divided into weeks.
- Each week will have a certain set of criteria that must be met by its end.

The final timeline is as follows:

| Week | Dates        | Tasks to Be Completed                                                                                   |
| :--- | :----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 2-14 to 2-21 | Notebook basics, begin brainstorming, create mockups                                                    |
| 2    | 2-22 to 2-28 | Finish brainstorming, create formal plans, draft pseudocode, UML diagrams, finalize system architecture |
| 3    | 3-01 to 3-06 | Finish design document in totality, finalize plans and system structure                                 |
