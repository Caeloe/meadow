## Understanding and Navigating the Notebook

### #notebook/introduction

Entry: 1
Author: Aster Lee<br>Date: 2026-02-14<br>Working Version: 0.0.0

### Navigating the Notebook

- **Any standard Markdown viewer should be able to fully utilize this notebook.**
	- Section links, external links, image embedding, and tables should all be in accordance with standard Markdown syntax.
- **The table of contents contains hyperlinks for convenience.**
	- Entry titles will be hyperlinked to direct the viewer to the corresponding entry.
- **This document should be viewed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for best results**
	- While not vital to function, using Obsidian will provide additional functionality, such as usage of the graph view and functionality of the Tags system. 
- **Some artifacts be appear in other Markdown viewers as a consequence of missing Obsidian functionality.**
	- (e.g. A section of text may be have a preceding hash. This is from the Tag system used in Obsidian. Example: `#tagged_text`)

### Notebook Entry Formatting

**All entries will share the same heading as follows:**

![*Fig. 1.*](photos/2026-02-14_template_image.png)

* *Title* - Title of entry. Gives a specific description or focus for the entry
* *Subtitle Tag* - A subtitle that categorizes the entry into broader categories of similar entries. Takes advantage of Obsidian's tag system to easily organize and search for items.
* *Entry #* - Numerical index for entry. Helps to maintain chronological order and easy identification of entries.
* *Date* - Provides date entry was written.
* *Working version* - Indicates which version of the project the entry was working on. Follows standard [semantic versioning convention.](https://semver.org/)

## Rationale for Selecting Obsidian as a Text Editor

- **Obsidian is a strong tool for organization and workflow management.**
	- Its links, backlinks, tags, and graph view all contribute to a strongly organized system that improves workflow.
	- Less specifically, the general layout, controls, and presentation of tools all feel intuitive to me. This makes it a very appealing choice.
- **Obsidian natively supports Markdown.**
	- Obsidian uses Markdown as its standard text markup language, which vastly improves compatibility with HTML. 
		- Markdown is a markup language accepted as industry standard. It is almost universally utilized in all facets of programming, such as in README files. 
		- Writing documentation in Markdown will ensure this project's documentation is accessible to any interested party.
	- Markdown is also natively supported to be previewed in GitHub repositories. This allows users to preview all documents without having to download any files.
